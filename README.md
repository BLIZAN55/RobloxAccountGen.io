This is a simple Node.js script to automate the creation of Roblox accounts. It utilizes the Playwright library for browser automation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Open the `config.js` file and update the following variables:
    - `ROBLOX_SIGNUP_URL`: URL of the Roblox sign-up page.
    - `PAST_ACCOUNTS_FILE`: File path to store past account details.
2. Ensure you have an available email address that is not linked to an existing Roblox account.
3. Run the script using `npm start`.
4. The script will create Roblox accounts with random credentials and store them in the specified file.

## Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying the following variables in the `config.js` file:
- `MIN_AGE`: Minimum age for account creation.
